QDogs BBQ Website I have redone my family's restaurant website for this project. Most of the content as far as images, descriptions, menu items, etc. have all been pulled from either the current website or facebook page. Link to facebook is found within the project on the home page under contact information and current website is www.qdogsbbq.com. Upon completion of the web developement bootcamp, I am going to improve and build an even more interactive and user friendly website for our family's restaurant.

Once the website is loaded to the default home page you will see a navigation bar across the top of the screen and the other pages found within the site.  Home page is mainly for viewing.  Within the menu page you will see a list of tabs labeled with menu categories. You can click on the different tabs to see the different items offered in each category. Within the live music page you will see a bootstrap carousel that has navigation to scroll through the images, with an automatic interval for slide change. There is also a google calendar linked to ensure calendar stays up to date with current data.  Within the catering page you will see a form for input that has been linked to formspree to ensure data is being submitted.

In this project you will find HTML, CSS, Javascript, & linked bootstrap.  All of these languages will work together
to create one final project. 

For future updates and planning I would like to continue to develop my skills to create a cleaner website.  Some ideas I have 
improvement are:
  1. collaspe navigation bar
  2. Oder online feature that interacts with restaraunt POS. 
  3. Requiring future dates/defaulting selection to current date input fields

                <p>
                    All of our BBQ starts with hand selected, choice graded, Iowa pork and beef. 
                    We hand rub each piece with our very own dry rub and slowly smoke over the finest cherry wood. 
                    Every piece of meat is closely monitored for the perfect temperature and tenderness. 
                    Our large cuts of meat like brisket and pork shoulder take upwards of 20 hours to reach optimal taste and tenderness. 
                    We try very hard to have all items available on our menu, however selling out of a particular 
                    selection is common with low and slow authentic BBQ and hope you understand.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cheers QDog!
